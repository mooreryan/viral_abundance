# Figures #

## Cool figures ##

- mean kmer coverage from assembly param sweeps
- mean coverage line charts from param sweeps
- gasic output (maybe compared to naive recruitment method)
- mock community creation figures
  - `selections_from_rank_abundance_curve.pdf`
  - `gc_hist_for_mock.pdf`
  - mock community table
- simseq vs grinder figures
- `cov_all_graphs.pdf`
- `error_models.pdf`
- `param_sweep_averages.pdf`
- `steve_summer_2014_3.pdf`

## Questions ##

- what is BiosporcOutputFromGrinderWithInputReads.xlsx
- what is UnassignedContigsStats-bad.xslx

## Issues ##

- estimated coverage should be

        num_reads * mean_read_len / genome_len

- I emailed SOAP about kmer coverage. Waiting on a response.
